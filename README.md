# SAMPLING [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06323)
The official code for [SAMPLING: Scene-adaptive Hierarchical Multiplane Images Representation for Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image (ICCV23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06323).

## Overview
Given a single image captured in an outdoor scene, our method synthesizes novel views with fewer visual artifacts, geometric deformities, and blurs. Notably, our method models favorable intricate details, such as tiny objects, symbols, and traffic signs, resulting in more photo-realistic views.

## SAMPLING(pic/overview)
Recent novel view synthesis methods obtain promising results for relatively small scenes, e.g., indoor environments and scenes with a few objects, but tend to fail for unbounded outdoor scenes with a single image as input. In this paper, we introduce SAMPLING, a Scene-adaptive Hierarchical Multiplane Images Representation for Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image based on improved multiplane images (MPI). Observing that depth distribution varies significantly for unbounded outdoor scenes, we employ an adaptive-bins strategy for MPI to arrange planes in accordance with each scene image. To represent intricate geometry and multi-scale details, we further introduce a hierarchical refinement branch, which results in high-quality synthesized novel views. Our method demonstrates considerable performance gains in synthesizing large-scale unbounded outdoor scenes using a single image on the KITTI dataset and generalizes well to the unseen Tanks and Temples dataset.
